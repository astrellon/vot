A free roaming space shooter (in theory).

Building
--------

Currently compiles using clang but should work with g++ just fine.
```
sudo apt-get install clang libsfml-dev
```

```
make
./Vot
```
Sounds
------

Some sounds have been created using [sfxr](http://www.drpetter.se/project_sfxr.html) and some have been taken from a [Freespace 2 mod](http://www.matrixgames.com/forums/tm.asp?m=2964479&mpage=1&key=sound%2Ceffects&#2964479). All sounds are temporary and considered placeholder and I claim no ownership.
